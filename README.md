# Merge Sort
Merge sort is an algorithm that sorts a list of elements that takes the _divide-and-conquer_ approach. This means that merge sort is recursive in nature. Recursion is when the algorithm calls itself and divides up the work into parts. This can be done in parallel which increases performance. In the example, it is not done in parallel. I'll work on that in feature iterations.

Merge sort is faster, on average, than other sorting algorithms such as [bubble sort](https://github.com/pmcavoy89/bubble-sort) as it runs in O(n log n) time. This is given that n is sufficiently large.
