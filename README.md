# Merge Sort
Merge sort is an algorithm that sorts a list of elements that takes the `divide-and-conquer` approach. This means that merge sort is recursive in nature. Recursion is when the algorithm calls itself and divides up the work into parts. Merge sort is much faster than other sorting algorithms such as [bubble sort](https://github.com/pmcavoy89/bubble-sort) and runs in O(n log n) time.
